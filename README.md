In this repository I am pushing the current learning progress on the Java Backend Developer of the learning portal [hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/12). 

The course is built on Grable and contains two packages with my solutions:
1. [Tasks solutions on basic topics](https://github.com/ILYA-NASA/Simple_Banking_System/tree/master/Topics)
2. [Project of this track ](https://github.com/ILYA-NASA/Simple_Banking_System/tree/master/Simple%20Banking%20System). Below I will show you a screenshot with a description of this project.

In addition, this is a good opportunity for me to practice writing commits for an auto-build project.

Thank you for your attention ;)
